## **Relational Databases** 
In this course, I studied SQL, the PostgreSQL DBMS, and some Bash commands. I learned how to:
  - Create and remove databases
  - Create, remove and alter tables
  - Create, remove and alter columns
  - Use primary and foreign keys
  - Use composite primary key
  - Use SQL with Bash to manipulate the database
